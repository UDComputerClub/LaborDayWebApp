# LaborDayWebApp

The website is now live!! go to https://evolveyoself.com/ to try it out

This is the Labor Day weekend web app project. Our mission: to boldly create a
web app that no man has created before (hopefully). This web app allows the user
to upload "before" and "after" images and create a Pok√©mon evolution animation
between them.

To work on the project:

* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Git](http://git-scm.com).
* Open a terminal (preferably bash, but CMD or PowerShell should also work).
* Clone the project with the command `git clone
  https://github.com/UDComputerClub/LaborDayWebApp`. Enter your username and
  password at the prompts.
* Install the dependencies with the command `npm install`.
* To run the server, run `npm start`. This will start a server running at port
  3000. You can stop it at any time by pressing control-c in your terminal.
* While the server is running, you can navigate to <localhost:3000> in your
  browser to view the web app.
